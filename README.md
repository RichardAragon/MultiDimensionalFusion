# Multi Dimensional Fusion

**Multi Dimensional Fusion** is an open-source framework for fusing data across multiple modalities into a unified topological representation. By treating different modalities (e.g., text, images, sound) as dimensions of a shared conceptual space, this framework enables seamless multi-modal understanding, transfer, and generation.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Specific Encoders**: Supports text, image, and sound encoders that map input data to a shared latent space.
- **Shared Fusion Space**: A unified representation space that aligns and fuses data across modalities.
- **Multi-Modality Training**: Flexible training on single or combined modalities with customizable modality combinations.
- **Topological Integration**: Embeds data into a manifold space to preserve and utilize the shape of the data.
- **Cross-Modality Compatibility**: Ensures aligned representations for applications such as cross-modal retrieval, multi-modal generation, and transfer learning.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multi-dimensional-fusion.git
cd multi-dimensional-fusion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Example Workflow

1. **Define Your Data**:
   Prepare datasets for text, image, and sound modalities. Use precomputed embeddings or raw data with compatible encoders.

2. **Train the Model**:
   Train the fusion model using multi-modal datasets:

   ```python
   from fusion_model import FusionModel, FusionTrainer

   # Initialize model
   shared_dim = 128
   model = FusionModel(shared_dim=shared_dim)
   trainer = FusionTrainer(model)

   # Prepare datasets
   text_data = torch.randn(100, 300)  # Example text embeddings
   image_data = torch.randn(100, 2048)  # Example image embeddings
   sound_data = torch.randn(100, 1024)  # Example sound embeddings

   # Train the model
   trainer.train([text_data, image_data, sound_data], None, [
       ('text',), ('image',), ('sound',),
       ('text', 'image'), ('text', 'sound'), ('image', 'sound'),
       ('text', 'image', 'sound')
   ], epochs=5)
   ```

3. **Evaluate and Use**:
   Use the trained model for cross-modal tasks, such as generating one modality from another or multi-modal retrieval.

### Customization

- Add additional encoders for new modalities by extending the `FusionModel`.
- Customize training and loss functions to fit specific use cases.
